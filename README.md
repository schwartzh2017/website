# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial). After finishing this tutorial, I'll be able to use Git to track changes in projects, back up data, share my work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git. 

For more information on Git, see the official [*Git documentation*](https://git-scm.com/doc).
